# Bootstrap-Portfolio
## Overview

##### GitHub Pages Link: (https://derekgeorg.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/)

This project was our second assignment of the *UT Austin Coding Boot Camp*.

We were tasked with taking our previous Portfolio page made with only HTML and CSS and implement Bootstrap styling to it.

### Learned:
Bootstrap Grid System - Col/Row
Linking Bootstrap CDNs
Working with Bootstraps predefined classes

### All pages are composed of:
* A Bootstrap Navbar with logo/name and links to About, Porfolio and Contact to navigate website

* One main content section

* A sticky footer

## ABOUT

## PORTFOLIO
Because this was just our second assignment the projects listed on the *Portfolio* page don't link anywhere. Rather than updating this Portfolio site with actual projects, I recreated the entire site later.
